## Diagnosis		
There was a typo in `browser/base/content/aboutNetError.js`.		
Issue with Symantec certificate is generally harmless and therefore was not suppose to display intimidating yellow border when user encounters a website with invalid Symantec certificate. 		
However due to a typo, FireFox was not checking the condition properly and displayed yellow border.	
Though most of websites had already resolved their issue with Symantec certificate, this bug had to be resolved as it is part of security feature of FireFox and should be consistant in terms of when yellow border should appear. By fixing this bug, it will promote consistancy and reduce confusion of when to display yellow border for future developer.

## Solution 
This bug is caused by a simple typo, solution is to fix `erroCodeString` to `errorCodeString`		
in `browser/base/content/aboutNetError.js`
